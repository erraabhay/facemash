        <p><strong>How It Works:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Two random photos are displayed side by side for comparison</li>
            <li>Click on the photo you find more appealing to cast your vote</li>
            <li>Photos are ranked using the sophisticated Elo rating system</li>
            <li>Each vote affects the photos' rankings in real-time</li>
            <li>View current rankings and statistics on the Rankings page</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>The Elo Rating System:</strong></p>
        <p>We use the same rating system used in chess rankings. Each photo starts with a base rating of 1400 points. When you vote, points are transferred between photos based on their current ratings and match outcome.</p>
